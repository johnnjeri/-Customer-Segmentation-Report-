    "# Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. You'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, you'll apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you completed the first term of this program, you will be familiar with the first part of this project, from the unsupervised learning project. The versions of those two datasets used in this project will include many more features and has not been pre-cleaned. You are also free to choose whatever approach you'd like to analyzing the data rather than follow pre-determined steps. In your work on this project, make sure that you carefully document your steps and decisions, since your main deliverable for this project will be a blog post reporting your findings."

    "## Part 0: Get to Know the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four data files associated with this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. Use the information from the first two files to figure out how customers (\"CUSTOMERS\") are similar to or differ from the general population at large (\"AZDIAS\"), then use your analysis to make predictions on the other two files (\"MAILOUT\"), predicting which recipients are most likely to become a customer for the mail-order company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"CUSTOMERS\" file contains three extra columns ('CUSTOMER_GROUP', 'ONLINE_PURCHASE', and 'PRODUCT_GROUP'), which provide broad information about the customers depicted in the file. The original \"MAILOUT\" file included one additional column, \"RESPONSE\", which indicated whether or not each recipient became a customer of the company. For the \"TRAIN\" subset, this column has been retained, but in the \"TEST\" subset it has been removed; it is against that withheld column that your final predictions will be assessed in the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, all of the remaining columns are the same between the three data files. For more information about the columns depicted in the files, you can refer to two Excel spreadsheets provided in the workspace. [One of them](./DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx) is a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category. [The other](./DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx) is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below cell, we've provided some initial code to load in the first two datasets. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project that they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so an additional argument in the [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call has been included to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the datasets, it may take some time for them to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice when the data is loaded in that a warning message will immediately pop up. Before you really start digging into the modeling and analysis, you're going to need to perform some cleaning. Take some time to browse the structure of the data and look over the informational spreadsheets to understand the data values. Make some decisions on which features to keep, which features to drop, and if any revisions need to be made on data formats. It'll be a good idea to create a function with pre-processing steps, since you'll need to clean all of the datasets before you work with them."

    "After assessing the data missing on a rwo perspective, I have removed rows missing more than 8(2.5%) values. as a result, the final dataframe has 745,836 (83.6%) values. I think retaining 83% of the original dataframe isa good start. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the above statistics and histograms, 74.59% of the data comprises rows with no missing values.Therefore, about three quarters of our dataset is complete. Also, we can see that there appears to be multiple groups in small patches with more than 10% of the missing data in rows making them as outliers. With 8 or less missing data in rows, we still have 83.72% of data retained. With more than 8 missing data in rows, there is not substantial increase in cumulative percentage of data retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, 2.5% of 329 columns or features turns out be in 8. We can observe that after 8 missing values in a row, there is not a substantial increase in cumulative percentage of data retained. Therefore, finding a break at 8 missing values in a row could be the appropriate choice if we have to keep rows with few missing values and droping the rows with more than 8 missing values would not lead to major issue. So, droping rows which contains more than 8 missing values in a row leads to reduction of 145,386 number of rows and our total number of rows after reduction would make our azdias dataset with 745,836 number of rows and it contains rows with maximum 8 missing values in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare the distribution of 7 random selected features or columns that are missing less than 2 data values in these 2 subsets(One with 8 or less missing values & other with more than 8 missing values) as can be seen from the above bar charts, we could see that the distribution of columns data within subset of few missing values is qualitatively different from the columns data within subset of many missing values. We can see features 'D19_VERSAND_DATUM', 'D19_SCHUHE', 'D19_FREIZEIT' seems comparable and other features namely 'FINANZ_ANLEGER', 'SEMIO_REL' are highly different in distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the clustering algorithm K-means requires no missing information to work and that the dataset is made up of mainly ordinal and categorical data, where imputing values with means, modes or medians can impact the truth of the dataset much more than if the dataset was made up of numerical data. Therefore, it seems more appropriate to minimize imputing missing data and maintain the integrity at maximum. For this reason, I decided to retain only columns with 2.5% or less missing values. "

Since most of the columns are categorical or ordinal in nature, mean and median could have given us values other than permissible values of which the columns comprises. The mean and median would have squashed the dataset distibutions towards a center which has no relevance with categorical and ordinal distributions. The mode seemed the logical choice as it would reinforce the highest value for each feature making them stand out more in the later analysis for customer segments."

    "Each principal component is a unit vector that points in the direction of highest variance (after accounting for the variance captured by earlier principal components). The further a weight is from zero, the more the principal component is in the direction of the corresponding feature. If two features have large weights of the same sign (both positive or both negative), then increases in one tend expect to be associated with increases in the other. To contrast, features with different signs can be expected to show a negative correlation: increases in one variable should result in a decrease in the other."

    "Consider the proportion of persons in each cluster for the general population, and the proportions for the customers. If we think the company's customer base to be universal, then the cluster assignment proportions should be fairly similar between the two. If there are only particular segments of the population that are interested in the company's products, then we should see a mismatch from one to the other. If there is a higher proportion of persons in a cluster for the customer data compared to the general population (e.g. 5% of persons are assigned to a cluster for the general population, but 15% of the customer data is closest to that cluster's centroid) then that suggests the people in that cluster to be a target audience for the company. On the other hand, the proportion of the data in a cluster being larger in the general population than the customer data (e.g. only 2% of customers closest to a population centroid that captures 6% of the data) suggests that group of persons to be outside of the target demographics."

ROC curves give us the ability to assess the performance of the classifier over its entire operating range. The most widely-used measure is the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC can be used to compare the performance of two or more classifiers. A single threshold can be selected and the classifiers’ performance at that point compared, or the overall performance can be compared by considering the AUC\". Compared to the F1 score, the ROC does not require optimizing a threshold for each label."

    "## Part 3: Kaggle Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've created a model to predict which individuals are most likely to respond to a mailout campaign, it's time to test that model in competition through Kaggle. If you click on the link [here](http://www.kaggle.com/t/21e6d45d4c574c7fa2d868f0e8c83140), you'll be taken to the competition page where, if you have a Kaggle account, you can enter. If you're one of the top performers, you may have the chance to be contacted by a hiring manager from Arvato or Bertelsmann for an interview!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your entry to the competition should be a CSV file with two columns. The first column should be a copy of \"LNR\", which acts as an ID number for each individual in the \"TEST\" partition. The second column, \"RESPONSE\", should be some measure of how likely each individual became a customer – this might not be a straightforward probability. As you should have found in Part 2, there is a large output class imbalance, where most individuals did not respond to the mailout. Thus, predicting individual classes and using accuracy does not seem to be an appropriate performance evaluation method. Instead, the competition will be using AUC to evaluate performance. The exact values of the \"RESPONSE\" column do not matter as much: only that the higher values try to capture as many of the actual customers as possible, early in the ROC curve sweep."
